# onenet.client/Bushi-Secret Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Project onenet x Bushi
* **Team Name:** onenet.
* **Payment Address:** secret1p3sph6ws3mxvkcfnwyzctf5d7fyzjtue2930cw



## Project Description
onenet.-
* onenet. is a video game platform that will host multiple cross-functionality video games. This platform will work in tandem with our tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets to be able to be used in all video games hosted on this client.

Imagine that Jessy purchased $100 of token in onenet.'s client. She purchases this token to use on Game 1, a video game hosted on onenet. Though she purchased these coins originally to use in Game 1, her interest has turned to wanting to use these tokens on assets in Game 2. Because both games are hosted on onenet., she is able to use these newly purchased tokens and use them in all games hosted on the client. This is interchangeable with NFT(s).

Bushi -
* Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game that aims to break into the esports industry as well as to offer a large scale video game on the Secret Network and the Cosmos. This game aims to blur the lines of video games and blockchain to seamlessly create an enjoyable player experience for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday video game advocates alike.

This is the first video game being released and hosted by onenet. and onenet.'s client. We aim to incorporate cross-game functionality with assets created in Bushi such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. The incorporation of cross-game functionalities between our assets will inevitably be a large focus of our goal in the future.

## Problem / Solution


### Problem 1  
*Oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games -*  

Crypto gaming is relatively new within the crypto space and though there are many attempts to capture this rapidly growing market, few projects are able to offer a video game that has long term playability, high-quality art, and a truly immersive experience. The oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games fail to capture long-term players in blockchain and therefore inadvertently lessen the shelf life of the community as well as the game.


### Solution 1
*A truly high-quality video game with a focus on competitive gaming to entice long-term playability -*

onenet. aims to offer an extremely high quality video game with a rather large project scope and vision. Our team is composed of industry professionals with experience in well-known AAA companies such as Blizzard and EA as well as smaller, yet professional, indie game studios. Additionally, we look to offer a 3D competitive experience that will break into the competitive gaming industry as a whole.


What sets Bushi apart:
* 3D world and character models
* High-Quality animations, particles, and effects
* Textured, painted, and shaded environments (4 maps as of writing this)
* Progressive/Immersive game design


> We truly believe that players in Bushi should experience an immersive video game first and foremost. Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience in order to onboard long lasting users not only to the game, but the network/community as a whole.     
  
### Problem 2 
*Limited utility and usage for video game assets both in crypto gaming and outside -*

Many games outside of blockchain limit the trading of assets purchased for the game. This means that the time, money, and effort put into a video game are lost without anything tangible being given back.

In crypto gaming, this is tackled by allowing tokens and NFTs to be traded for other assets, including USDT which can be converted to USD. Though this is something that we truly believe in and support, the value of the player’s time, money, and effort should be rewarded even further.

### Solution 2
*Cross-game usability/functionality for digital assets created for Bushi-*

onenet.’s vision is to build assets that are usable and valued in other video games. Bushi will be the first video game that will be released from onenet. and will allow for genesis mints of tokens and NFTs that will be usable in future games built by onenet./partners.

> Supply, demand, time spent, etc... All of these factors add to NFT value in Bushi. Players who spend more time playing the game get increasingly rewarded to further increase engagement and retention rates. Extremely skilled players can show off their high rarity skins that were only earned by completing certain challenges. 


### Problem 3: 
*Clear separation between the traditional gaming community and the crypto gaming community -*

As it stands, there is a negative stigma with video games being built in the crypto world from non-crypto enthusiasts. Many games built in crypto create clear and divisive disparities in strength/performance within the game based on “levels” of their NFT. In a sense, this is a pay-to-win model which traditional game enthusiasts have disliked throughout history.

### Solution 3
*A fair gaming model with no pay-to-win -*

In order to break into the esports scene as well as onboard traditional gamers into Secret Network/Cosmos, we highly value that all NFTs and digital assets within the game should NOT reflect in a person’s performance or strength. Essentially, this blurs the line between a traditional video game and a crypto video game by simply not allowing strength/performance disparities based on financial investments.

> The E-sports world over the past few years has continually increased viewership and participation through a variety of mediums: live streaming, tournaments, tiktoks, and youtube videos. By breaking into this scene, we can expose a larger audience of gamers to Secret Network and the potential of blockchain video games as a whole.

## Go-to-Market Plan
With our connections made through years of experience working in the traditional game industry, we look to capture non-crypto enthusiasts and onboard them onto our platform.

This is a major initiative we look to accomplish and is a major reason as to why we have focused on making Bushi a fun and exciting game for all markets to begin with.

We are here to blur the lines between web3 video games and the traditional market to grow our platform as well as the Secret Network and beyond.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
> *A vision to bring traditional gaming to the world of blockchain.*

Key KPIs:
* Unique Addresses onboarding
* Capturing Web3 Gaming Community
* Capturing a new Esports Demographic to Secret Network
* Onboarding of traditional gamers to blockchain gaming
* Awareness of SCRT brought by new users
* Attracting new Game Developers to launch on onenet. client/Secret Network
* Size of project scope for onenet. and Bushi

With the success of Bushi and onenet., this will break into a rapidly growing industry of competitive gaming in crypto. In a 2021 report, Newzoo estimates the global gaming industry to grow from $176 billion in 2021 to $200 bilion by 2024. By riding this wave, we can capture a market that has been overlooked by many video game focused projects in crypto and onboard new users to the value of Secret Network's privacy preserving technology. Furthermore, shooter video game types rank as 2nd overall in popularity within the gaming industry and Bushi serves as a project to tackle this metric.

## The Future and Our Commitment to Secret Network
In this new era of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, development teams come and go frequently. For us, we have a special connection with the Secret Network and plan to stay in the ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Our plans have always revovled around building on the Secret Network and we are dedicated to making onenet. client the absolute gaming hub for SN and the Cosmos. Here are some of our future plans:

Stage 0: Community Building x Fundraiser Event x Announcement of DAO
* | We’ve already begun our community building initiatives with the launch of our Discord, Twitter, and YouTube. We look to launch our website with intention of building a strong community for our upcoming NFT fundraiser event that will accelerate the development of Bushi and onenet.

Stage 1: Tokenomics Release x 2nd Playable Character Model Announcement
* | We look to release an in-depth whitepaper outlining onenet. that includes the tokenomics breakdown of our native currency, $ONE. This will set the stage for users to understand the full scope of onenet. and our title video game, Bushi.

* | We will also announce the 2nd playable character model as we bring more depth to Bushi and expand on lore.

Stage 2: Launch of Bushi x Launch of onenet. x Launch of DAO
* | The first optimized alpha version of Bushi will launch and players will be able to experience the gameplay first-hand for first time.

* | Users will also experience onenet.’s alpha version for the first time. During this time, holders of our NFT will be able to shape onenet. through governance and community discussions.

Stage 3: Token Release x Anti-Cheat Upgrade x Full Release of Bushi
*  We will release the $ONE token to the community to start the economy within onenet. and Bushi. During this time, we also look to integrate a large anti-cheat software overhaul for the community. This stage also marks the full release of Bushi to be free-to-play to the community.

Stage 4: First Major Tournament Event x In-Game Quality of LIfe Upgrade x Games Support
* | We will introduce in-game tournament quality of life changes such as observer camera, observer scoreboard, etc... With this, we will set the stage for our first official tournament event with a prize pool for top competitors.

* | Additionally, we will upgrade onenet. to support future planned video games hosted on the client.

Stage 5: Second onenet. Game Announcement x Modding Support
* | We will announce the second game coming to onenet. Details will be released near this time.

* | Modding support such as map creation, custom mechanics creation, etc... will be released to the onenet. client and Bushi.


## Additional Information  
Though Bushi will be the inevitable catalyst of future crypto gaming ventures by onenet., it is imperative to note that we plan to make cross-game functionality a focal point within our journey. By offering this cross-game functionality, we look to offer compelling, competitive, and highly addictive video games to the masses. By becoming one of the most dedicated video game development and blockchain specific studios in the Cosmos, we look to onboard users throughout to push Secret Network to being one of the most valued crypto projects in the space.

onenet. also looks to break heavily into the e-sports world by offering prizes to tournament winners and dedicated players. Not only will this carve a future of long lasting video games, but it will cultivate a community that has been missing in the crypto gaming world for some time. Though we are not the first to tackle this dilemma, we will certainly look to lead the way and carve a path for future developers to come.
