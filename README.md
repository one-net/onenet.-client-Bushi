## Project Description
Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game that aims to break into the e-sports industry as well as to offer a large scale video game on the Secret Network and the Cosmos. This game also aims to blur the lines of video games and blockchain to seamlessly create an enjoyable player experience for both cryto enthusiasts and regular video game advocates alike.

Though this is the first video game being released by onenet., we aim to incorporate cross-game functionality with assets created with this first product such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. The incorporation of cross-game functionalities between our assets will 

## Problem / Solution
Currently, Cosmos

Problem 1: The gaming community has a strife with pay-to-win games
Solution: No Pay-To-Win
We strongly believe in not creating imbalances of strength within a video game.

Gameplay mechanics should not be affected by any sort of outside assets.
Players in this game should experience a video game first.

Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience.

Problem 2: Lack of potential building value to NFTs
Solution: Player accounts hold value and players can add value through skin collection.

Supply, demand, time spent, etc... All of these factors are important for NFT value in Bushi. Players who spend more time playing the game get increasingly rewarded to further increase engagement and player retention rates.

Problem 3: Gaming in blockchain are unappealing/low quality
Solution: Players in this game should experience a video game first.

Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience.

Gameplay Mechanics

Players will work and communicate within a team to strategize a plan of attack or map out their best defense strategies.

Players can choose between different game modes that have specific objectives like Team Deatchmatch, Search & Destroy, Domination, etc...

## Go-to-Market Plan
A surge of growth in blockchain gaming has led to interested game developers to take on the task of creating an appealing shooter.

However, most focus on creating imbalances of strength with the addition of these NFTs. This only creates barriers of entry and financial disparities for players and their experiences.

$BSHI is the native token in Bushi. Players can earn $BSHI through playing matches as well as purchase bundles of $BSHI to customize and upgrade their NFTs.
Though $BSHI can be purchased, using this currency is not intended to add any additional performance increases or skill/strength disparities within the game.

NFT Breakdown
Players must mint an initial NFT to gain access to the alpha launch. These NFTs are meant to be cosmetic and are not intended to create disparities in performance within matches.
The NFTs serve as a “Battlepass” and tracks players’ progression with tiered rewards.
Unlock customizable skins by choosing paths through a progression tree. Going towards one path of the tree will lock all other paths.

We will be releasing a mintable NFT that includes access to play in private alpha, gain access to our DAO, access to upgradeable skin tiers, and more.

All revenue generated from our sales will go directly into additional development of the game and community.  We look to provide the best possible product for our initial alpha launch and our additional funding will help us in setting a higher standard for work.

For any community that is interested in being represented in the game as early playable models, collecting our BushiNFTs will be imperative.

Our grass-roots approach by accelerating our development process through our sales give us incentive to include communities that have opted to support us early in our announcements.
 These NFTs will also hold intrinsic voting weight for the future DAO and will be used to stake and vote on governance proposals.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
A vision to bring traditional gaming to the world of blockchain.

In a 2021 report, Newzoo estimates the global gaming industry to grow from $176 billion in 2021 to $200 bilion by 2024. We plan on riding this wave and join other developers to bring gaming to blockchain.

We strive to merge two different worlds and make a seamless experience blurring the lines between gaming and blockchain technology.
