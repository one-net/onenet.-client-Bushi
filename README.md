# onenet.client/Bushi-Secret Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Project onenet x Bushi
* **Team Name:** onenet.
* **Payment Address:** 



## Project Description
onenet.-
* onenet. is a multi-purpose video game launch client that will host multiple cross-functionality video games. This launch client will work in tandem with our tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets to be able to be used in all video games hosted on this client.

Imagine that Jessy purchased $100 of token in onenet.'s client. She purchases this token to use on Game 1, a video game hosted on onenet. Though she purchased these coins originally to use in Game 1, her interest has turned to wanting to use these tokens on assets in Game 2. Because both games are hosted on onenet., she is able to use these newly purchased tokens and use them in all games hosted on the client. This is interchangeable with NFT(s).

Bushi -
* Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game that aims to break into the esports industry as well as to offer a large scale video game on the Secret Network and the Cosmos. This game aims to blur the lines of video games and blockchain to seamlessly create an enjoyable player experience for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday video game advocates alike.

This is the first video game being released and hosted by onenet. and onenet.'s client. We aim to incorporate cross-game functionality with assets created in Bushi such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. The incorporation of cross-game functionalities between our assets will inevitably be a large focus of our goal in the future.

## Problem / Solution


### Problem 1  
*Oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games -*  

Crypto gaming is relatively new within the crypto space and though there are many attempts to capture this rapidly growing market, few projects are able to offer a video game that has long term playability, high-quality art, and a truly immersive experience. The oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games fail to capture long-term players in blockchain and therefore inadvertently lessen the shelf life of the community as well as the game.


### Solution 1
*A truly high-quality video game with a focus on competitive gaming to entice long-term playability -*

onenet. aims to offer an extremely high quality video game with a rather large project scope and vision. Our team is composed of industry professionals with experience in well-known AAA companies such as Blizzard and EA as well as smaller, yet professional, indie game studios. Additionally, we look to offer a 3D competitive experience that will break into the competitive gaming industry as a whole.


What sets Bushi apart:
* 3D world and character models
* High-Quality animations, particles, and effects
* Textured, painted, and shaded environments (4 maps as of writing this)
* Progressive/Immersive game design


> We truly believe that players in Bushi should experience an immersive video game first and foremost. Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience in order to onboard long lasting users not only to the game, but the network/community as a whole.     
  
### Problem 2 
*Limited utility and usage for video game assets both in crypto gaming and outside -*

Many games outside of blockchain limit the trading of assets purchased for the game. This means that the time, money, and effort put into a video game are lost without anything tangible being given back.

In crypto gaming, this is tackled by allowing tokens and NFTs to be traded for other assets, including USDT which can be converted to USD. Though this is something that we truly believe in and support, the value of the player’s time, money, and effort should be rewarded even further.

### Solution 2
*Cross-game usability/functionality for digital assets created for Bushi-*

onenet.’s vision is to build assets that are usable and valued in other video games. Bushi will be the first video game that will be released from onenet. and will allow for genesis mints of tokens and NFTs that will be usable in future games built by onenet./partners.

> Supply, demand, time spent, etc... All of these factors add to NFT value in Bushi. Players who spend more time playing the game get increasingly rewarded to further increase engagement and retention rates. Extremely skilled players can show off their high rarity skins that were only earned by completing certain challenges. 


### Problem 3: 
*Clear separation between the traditional gaming community and the crypto gaming community -*

As it stands, there is a negative stigma with video games being built in the crypto world from non-crypto enthusiasts. Many games built in crypto create clear and divisive disparities in strength/performance within the game based on “levels” of their NFT. In a sense, this is a pay-to-win model which traditional game enthusiasts have disliked throughout history.

### Solution 3
*A fair gaming model with no pay-to-win -*

In order to break into the esports scene as well as onboard traditional gamers into Secret Network/Cosmos, we highly value that all NFTs and digital assets within the game should NOT reflect in a person’s performance or strength. Essentially, this blurs the line between a traditional video game and a crypto video game by simply not allowing strength/performance disparities based on financial investments.

> The E-sports world over the past few years has continually increased viewership and participation through a variety of mediums: live streaming, tournaments, tiktoks, and youtube videos. By breaking into this scene, we can expose a larger audience of gamers to Secret Network and the potential of blockchain video games as a whole.

## Go-to-Market Plan
onenet. will release an NFT collection using sNFT technology to give initial purchasers access to the alpha launch for Bushi. With the genesis NFT collection, users will also gain lifetime access to every game launched on onenet. Furthermore, users will be awarded % airdrops of our token based on how many NFTs they own as well as how much they have burned into that NFT (NFT is upgradeable via tokens and relates to skin tiers 1-3 in Bushi).

We plan to have an initial coin offering after the launch of Alpha. We believe that showcasing Bushi and gaining a credible reputation within the community is imperative to having a successful coin distribution. However, these genesis NFTs will help in accelerating our development and essentially continue to help bootstrap this project. 

Marketing will be done by Leon and our partners to spread awareness to onenet. and Bushi. With the help of Secret Network, secretnodes, and other contributing members in the Cosmos, we will foster a community excited about Web3 Gaming as a whole.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
> *A vision to bring traditional gaming to the world of blockchain.*

Key KPIs:
* Unique Addresses onboarding
* Capturing Web3 Gaming Community
* Capturing a new Esports Demographic to Secret Network
* Onboarding of traditional gamers to blockchain gaming
* Awareness of SCRT brought by new users
* Attracting new Game Developers to launch on onenet. client/Secret Network
* Size of project scope for onenet. and Bushi

With the success of Bushi and onenet., this will break into a rapidly growing industry of competitive gaming in crypto. In a 2021 report, Newzoo estimates the global gaming industry to grow from $176 billion in 2021 to $200 bilion by 2024. By riding this wave, we can capture a market that has been overlooked by many video game focused projects in crypto and onboard new users to the value of Secret Network's privacy preserving technology. Furthermore, shooter video game types rank as 2nd overall in popularity within the gaming industry and Bushi serves as a project to tackle this metric.

## Development Roadmap
### Milestones 
These milestones may be completed previous/later than the estimated completion date. Updates will be made available to the public on a recurring basis.
The total grant request equals $150,000 USD to reach the launch of our alpha in 4 disbursements. Disbursement in $SCRT is also accepted. 

$25,000 awarded at the time of grant approval to bootstrap our project.

### M1:
Estimated Completion: 0-5 weeks - $15,000
  
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache License, Version 2.0 |
| 0b. | Description | The first milestone aims to raise awareness for Bushi as well as to create an NFT collection for private alpha access. Through the route of NFTs, we can allow early birds to be able to access the game by using SCRT to secure their spot to Bushi as well as grow a supportive community.|
| 0c. | Documentation | We will provide documentation on our Github as well as bi-weekly updates on overall development of onenet.'s client and Bushi. |
| 1. | Website Launch | onenet. will build a website to be a central point of all information as well as acting as a location to mint, store, and view genesis NFTs. This website will act as both a location to view onenet.'s information as well as showcase Bushi as a whole. |
| 2. | Keplr Integration | We have onboarded a smart contract developer to integrate Keplr into our website. |
| 3. | sNFT Mint Contracts | Our blockchain developer will create smart contracts to mint our genesis NFTs. This contract will also hold technology for users to be able to "upgrade" their NFTs that would correlate to upgraded skins within Bushi. |
| 4. | Migration from UE4 to UE5 | Unreal Engine has had a huge overhaul and recently released Unreal Engine 5. Porting the game to the new engine is a good investment for the later stages of the project and will increase the overall quality, performance, and workflow for our group. |

### M2:
Estimated Completion: 6-11 weeks - $20,000

  
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache License, Version 2.0 |
| 0b. | Description | Most of milestone two will push Bushi to get to Alpha and get it working with the created website as well as making sure that the NFT cosmetics get registered in-game |
| 1. | Whitepaper | We will deliver a detailed whitepaper for onenet.'s client and future incorporation of tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. |
| 2. | In-Game Character Skin Upgrade Functionality | In-game accounts should be able to query NFT metadata that are held in Keplr. |
| 3. | Character model 2 Integration | We will integrate the second playable character model into the game. |
| 4. | Smart Contract for upgrading NFTs | We will deliver a second contract to allow users to use SCRT to "upgrade" their NFTs that will showcase within the game's skin tier functions. |

### M3:
Estimated Completion: 12-19 weeks - $10,000

  
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache License, Version 2.0 |
| 0b. | Description | This milestone will overhaul the servers/infrastructure of Bushi to work within our central servers (started previous to milestone 1) |
| 1. | Create Alpha Game Launcher | While our biggest goal is to create a multifunctional launcher platform, by the end of this project we will have an alpha that allows for communication between the chain and Bushi.  |
| 2. | UI/UX Update | Current UI/UX is completely designed for functionality rather than presentability. Some changes will have to be made to match the design that was set for the website as well as the launcher. |
| 3. | Server Update/Infrastructure Overhaul | Perhaps the biggest change that will need to happen for Bushi is the migration from its current multiplayer system using third-party API to a standalone version that will allow us to host games in our selected servers. |


### M4:
Estimated Completion: 20-24 weeks - $5,000

  
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache License, Version 2.0 |
| 0b. | Description | The last phase includes getting Bushi to be completely playable for alpha launch. This includes server stress testing, bug fixing, complete UX/UI design, as well as quality assurance testing previous to the launch of alpha. |
| 1. | Quality Assurance Testing | Continuous testing will need to be done to make sure user experience is seamless from website , to launcher, to the actual game itself |
| 2. | Play Testing | Stress testing the servers will be required and to make sure that there are no issues that might break away from player immersion in-game. |
| 3. | Bug Fixing/Balancing | Any data collected during play testing and stress testing should provide enough information to let the game developers know what needs to be fixed or balanced.  |
| 4. | Launch Alpha! |  |

Throughout these milestones, continuous marketing plans will be executed on a rolling basis. With the help of BizDev, secretnodes, and other partners, we will be able to spread awareness and cultivate a supportive community previou to the launch of alpha.


## Future Plans (12-24 months) and Our Commitment to Secret Network
In this new era of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, development teams come and go frequently. For us, we have a special connection with the Secret Network and plan to stay in the ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Our plans have always revovled around building on the Secret Network and we are dedicated to making onenet. client the absolute gaming hub for SN and the Cosmos. Here are some of our future plans:

Bushi -
* Continuous Game Support for Bushi
* Continuous model, animation, art, etc. upgrades
* Ongoing playable character releases
* Creation of modding support
* Additional game modes
* Tournaments, prizes, and reward incentives
* Leaderboards and rankings functionality

onenet. client -
* Game hub for Secret Network and possibly the Cosmos
* Game NFT marketplace
* Friend list, chat, community forums, and news support
* Modding support for game developers
* Additional games on client

## Additional Information  
Though Bushi will be the inevitable catalyst of future crypto gaming ventures by onenet., it is imperative to note that we plan to make cross-game functionality a focal point within our journey. By offering this cross-game functionality, we look to offer compelling, competitive, and highly addictive video games to the masses. By becoming one of the most dedicated video game development and blockchain specific studios in the Cosmos, we look to onboard users throughout to push Secret Network to being one of the most valued crypto projects in the space.

onenet. also looks to break heavily into the e-sports world by offering prizes to tournament winners and dedicated players. Not only will this carve a future of long lasting video games, but it will cultivate a community that has been missing in the crypto gaming world for some time. Though we are not the first to tackle this dilemma, we will certainly look to lead the way and carve a path for future developers to come.
