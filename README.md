# Bushi-Secret Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Project Bushi
* **Team Name:** onenet.
* **Payment Address:** 



## Project Description
Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game that aims to break into the e-sports industry as well as to offer a large scale video game on the Secret Network and the Cosmos. This game aims to blur the lines of video games and blockchain to seamlessly create an enjoyable player experience for both cryto enthusiasts and regular video game advocates alike.

Though this is the first video game being released by onenet., we aim to incorporate cross-game functionality with assets created such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. The incorporation of cross-game functionalities between our assets will inevitably be a large focus of our goal.



## Problem / Solution


**Problem 1:** Crypto gaming is relatively new within the crypto space and though there are many attempts to capture this rapidly growing market, few projects are able to offer a video game that has long term playability, high-quality art, and a truly immersive experience. The oversaturation of 2D/pixelated and repurposed video games fail to capture a supportive community and therefore inadvertently lessen the shelf life of the community as well as the video game.
**Solution:** onenet. aims to offer an extremely high quality video game with a rather large project scope and vision. Though there are many 2D games and "pixel-
* We strongly believe in not creating imbalances of strength within a video game.
* Gameplay mechanics should not be affected by any sort of outside assets.

> Players in this game should experience a video game first. Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience. Most multiplayer games outside of the blockchain world currently do not offer players the ability to trade or sell their skins that they have earned.       
  
**Problem 2:** Lack of long-term building value of NFTs  
**Solution:** Upgradeable and customizable NFTs  
* Players would have the ability to personalize their experience and characters in the game.
* Player accounts hold value and players can increasingly add value through skin collection.

> Supply, demand, time spent, etc... All of these factors add to NFT value in Bushi. Players who spend more time playing the game get increasingly rewarded to further increase engagement and retention rates. Extremely skilled players can show off their high rarity skins that were only earned by completing certain challenges. 

**Problem 3:** Gaming in blockchain are unappealing/low quality and disconnected from the actual gaming community  
**Solution:** Players in this game should experience a video game first before the added benefits of blockchain.
* Gamers are in a completely different world from blockchain-- most do not understand its value and do not care for it. What they would experience must be as seamless and inviting as possible. 
* The idea of pay-to-earn is an inherent bonus to players-- it should not be a selling point.

> The E-sports world over the past few years has continually increased viewership and partricipation through so many mediums: live streaming, tournaments, tiktoks, and youtube videos. The gaming community loves competition first and any hindrance of graphics and gameplay is very obvious to them and they are incredibly critical of it. Any added benefits, including liquid assets, must only be and should only be a bonus to the gaming experience.

## Go-to-Market Plan
A surge of growth in blockchain gaming has led to interested game developers to take on the task of creating an appealing shooter.

However, most focus on creating imbalances of strength with the addition of these NFTs. This only creates barriers of entry and financial disparities for players and their experiences.

$BSHI is the native token in Bushi. Players can earn $BSHI through playing matches as well as purchase bundles of $BSHI to customize and upgrade their NFTs.
Though $BSHI can be purchased, using this currency is not intended to add any additional performance increases or skill/strength disparities within the game.

NFT Breakdown
Players must mint an initial NFT to gain access to the alpha launch. These NFTs are meant to be cosmetic and are not intended to create disparities in performance within matches.
The NFTs serve as a “Battlepass” and tracks players’ progression with tiered rewards.
Unlock customizable skins by choosing paths through a progression tree. Going towards one path of the tree will lock all other paths.

We will be releasing a mintable NFT that includes access to play in private alpha, gain access to our DAO, access to upgradeable skin tiers, and more.

All revenue generated from our sales will go directly into additional development of the game and community.  We look to provide the best possible product for our initial alpha launch and our additional funding will help us in setting a higher standard for work.

For any community that is interested in being represented in the game as early playable models, collecting our BushiNFTs will be imperative.

Our grass-roots approach by accelerating our development process through our sales give us incentive to include communities that have opted to support us early in our announcements.
 These NFTs will also hold intrinsic voting weight for the future DAO and will be used to stake and vote on governance proposals.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
> *A vision to bring traditional gaming to the world of blockchain.*

In a 2021 report, Newzoo estimates the global gaming industry to grow from $176 billion in 2021 to $200 bilion by 2024. We plan on riding this wave and join other developers to bring gaming to blockchain.

* **Uniting the Cosmos**
* **Bringing Esports to Blockchain**
* **More traffic for the network**
* **Promoting Upgradeable NFT Value**  

We strive to merge two different worlds and make a seamless experience blurring the lines between gaming and blockchain technology.

## Additional Information  
The resulting number of combinations is virtually limitless. The team is even planning a large-scale Rarity Contest with a $100,000 prize fund to offer an extra incentive to players who invest in designing rarer, better-looking sharks. After that, the collection will be fixed, and the upgrading process will stop.

On the technical level, each add-on trait is a separate NFT. When it is added to a shark, the smart contract burns the original asset and creates a new one - with the new trait included and with updated metadata. Since SharkRace runs on Binance Smart Chain (a relatively cheap and scalable blockchain), these transactions don't incur a lot of additional costs for the player.
