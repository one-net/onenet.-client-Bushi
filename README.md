# Bushi-Secret Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Project Bushi
* **Team Name:** onenet.
* **Payment Address:** 



## Project Description
Bushi is a third-person competitive shooter video game that aims to break into the esports industry as well as to offer a large scale video game on the Secret Network and the Cosmos. This game aims to blur the lines of video games and blockchain to seamlessly create an enjoyable player experience for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday video game advocates alike.

Though this is the first video game being released by onenet., we aim to incorporate cross-game functionality with assets created such as tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets. The incorporation of cross-game functionalities between our assets will inevitably be a large focus of our goal in the future.



## Problem / Solution


### Problem 1  
Oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games -

Crypto gaming is relatively new within the crypto space and though there are many attempts to capture this rapidly growing market, few projects are able to offer a video game that has long term playability, high-quality art, and a truly immersive experience. The oversaturation of small scale and repurposed video games fail to capture long-term players in blockchain and therefore inadvertently lessen the shelf life of the community as well as the game.


**Solution:** onenet. aims to offer an extremely high quality video game with a rather large project scope and vision. Though there are many 2D games and "pixel-
A truly high-quality video game with a focus on competitive gaming to entice long-term playability -

onenet. aims to offer an extremely high quality video game with a rather large project scope and vision. Our team is composed of industry professionals with experience in well-known AAA companies such as Blizzard and EA as well as smaller, yet professional, indie game studios. Additionally, we look to offer a 3D competitive experience that will break into the competitive gaming industry as a whole.

What sets Bushi apart:
* 3D world and character models
* High-Quality animations, particles, and effects
* Textured, painted, and shaded environments (4 maps as of writing this)
* Progressive/Immersive game design


> We truly believe that players in Bushi should experience an immersive video game first and foremost. Any added benefits, including liquid assets, should be a bonus to the gaming experience in order to onboard long lasting users not only to the game, but the network/community as a whole.     
  
### Problem 2 
Limited utility and usage for video game assets both in crypto gaming and outside -

Many games outside of blockchain limit the trading of assets purchased for the game. This means that the time, money, and effort put into a video game are lost without anything tangible being given back.

In crypto gaming, this is tackled by allowing tokens and NFTs to be traded for other assets, including USDT which can be converted to USD. Though this is something that we truly believe in and support, the value of the player’s time, money, and effort should be rewarded even further.

**Solution:** 
Cross-game usability/functionality for digital assets created for Bushi-

onenet.’s vision is to build assets that are usable and valued in other video games. Bushi will be the first video game that will be released from onenet. and will allow for genesis mints of tokens and NFTs that will be usable in future games built by onenet./partners.

> Supply, demand, time spent, etc... All of these factors add to NFT value in Bushi. Players who spend more time playing the game get increasingly rewarded to further increase engagement and retention rates. Extremely skilled players can show off their high rarity skins that were only earned by completing certain challenges. 


### Problem 3: 
Clear separation between the traditional gaming community and the crypto gaming community -

As it stands, there is a negative stigma with video games being built in the crypto world from non-crypto enthusiasts. Many games built in crypto create clear and divisive disparities in strength/performance within the game based on “levels” of their NFT. In a sense, this is a pay-to-win model which traditional game enthusiasts have disliked throughout history.

**Solution:**
A fair gaming model with no pay-to-win -

In order to break into the esports scene as well as onboard traditional gamers into Secret Network/Cosmos, we highly value that all NFTs and digital assets within the game should NOT reflect in a person’s performance or strength. Essentially, this blurs the line between a traditional video game and a crypto video game by simply not allowing strength/performance disparities based on financial investments.

> The E-sports world over the past few years has continually increased viewership and participation through a variety of mediums: live streaming, tournaments, tiktoks, and youtube videos. By breaking into this scene, we can expose a larger audience of gamers to Secret Network and the potential of blockchain video games as a whole.

## Go-to-Market Plan
A surge of growth in blockchain gaming has led to interested game developers to take on the task of creating an appealing shooter.

However, most focus on creating imbalances of strength with the addition of these NFTs. This only creates barriers of entry and financial disparities for players and their experiences.

$BSHI is the native token in Bushi. Players can earn $BSHI through playing matches as well as purchase bundles of $BSHI to customize and upgrade their NFTs.
Though $BSHI can be purchased, using this currency is not intended to add any additional performance increases or skill/strength disparities within the game.

NFT Breakdown
Players must mint an initial NFT to gain access to the alpha launch. These NFTs are meant to be cosmetic and are not intended to create disparities in performance within matches.
The NFTs serve as a “Battlepass” and tracks players’ progression with tiered rewards.
Unlock customizable skins by choosing paths through a progression tree. Going towards one path of the tree will lock all other paths.

We will be releasing a mintable NFT that includes access to play in private alpha, gain access to our DAO, access to upgradeable skin tiers, and more.

All revenue generated from our sales will go directly into additional development of the game and community.  We look to provide the best possible product for our initial alpha launch and our additional funding will help us in setting a higher standard for work.

For any community that is interested in being represented in the game as early playable models, collecting our BushiNFTs will be imperative.

Our grass-roots approach by accelerating our development process through our sales give us incentive to include communities that have opted to support us early in our announcements.
 These NFTs will also hold intrinsic voting weight for the future DAO and will be used to stake and vote on governance proposals.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
> *A vision to bring traditional gaming to the world of blockchain.*

In a 2021 report, Newzoo estimates the global gaming industry to grow from $176 billion in 2021 to $200 bilion by 2024. We plan on riding this wave and join other developers to bring gaming to blockchain.

* **Uniting the Cosmos**
* **Bringing Esports to Blockchain**
* **More traffic for the network**
* **Promoting Upgradeable NFT Value**  

We strive to merge two different worlds and make a seamless experience blurring the lines between gaming and blockchain technology.

## Additional Information  
Though Bushi will be the inevitable catalyst of future crypto gaming ventures by onenet., it is imperative to note that we plan to make cross-game functionality a focal point within our journey. By offering this cross-game functionality, we look to offer compelling, competitive, and highly addictive video games to the masses. By becoming one of the most dedicated video game development and blockchain specific studios in the Cosmos, we look to onboard users throughout to push Secret Network to being one of the most valued crypto projects in the space.

onenet. also looks to break heavily into the e-sports world by offering prizes to tournament winners and dedicated players. Not only will this carve a future of long lasting video games, but it will cultivate a community that has been missing in the crypto gaming world for some time. Though we are not the first to tackle this dilemma, we will certainly look to lead the way as we progress.
